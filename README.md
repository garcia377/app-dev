1. **HARRY POTTER**
: Rowling has described Harry as "the prism through which I view death", and further stated that "all of my characters are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of death". While Harry Potter can be viewed as a story about good vs. evil, its moral divisions are not absolute.
2. **STRANGER THINGS**
: a mix of investigative drama and supernatural elements portrayed with horror and childlike sensibilities
3. **HIGH POTENTIAL**
: Written by Drew Goddard ("The Good Place," "The Martian") and starring Kaitlin Olson, "High Potential" follows a single mom with an exceptional mind, whose unconventional knack for solving crimes leads to an unusual and unstoppable partnership with a by-the-book seasoned detective
